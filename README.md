# 🧠 LeetCode Practice – Easy & Medium Problems
A curated collection of my LeetCode problem solutions, covering all Java programming and data structure basics. 

Focused on clean, well-documented code. Rather than just going for the optimized solution I have started from a brute force approach and then modified to make it more efficient.

In each program, you will find a clear description of the problem statement with a sample test data and a brief description of the approach as I believe that is the best way to start solving any problem.
